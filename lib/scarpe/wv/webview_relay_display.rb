  # process will spawn a worker with its own Webview::DisplayService
  # where the real Webview exists. By splitting the Webview
  # process from the Shoes drawables, it can be easier to return
  # control to Webview's event handler promptly. Also, the Ruby
  # process could run background threads if it wanted, and
  # otherwise behave like a process ***not*** containing Webview.
