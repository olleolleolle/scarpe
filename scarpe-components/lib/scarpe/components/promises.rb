  # Scarpe::Promise is a promises library, but one with no form of built-in
  # concurrency. Instead, promise callbacks are executed synchronously.
  # Even execution is usually synchronous, but can also be handled manually
  # for forms of execution not controlled in Ruby (like Webview.)
  #
  # Funny thing... We need promises as an API concept since we have a JS event
  # loop doing its thing, and we need to respond to actions that it takes.
  # But there's not really a Ruby implementation of Promises *without* an
  # attached form of concurrency. So here we are, writing our own :-/
  #
  # In theory you could probably write some kind of "no-op thread pool"
  # for the ruby-concurrency gem, pass it manually to every promise we
  # created and then raise an exception any time we tried to do something
  # in the background. That's probably more code than writing our own, though,
  # and we'd be fighting it constantly.
  #
  # This class is inspired by concurrent-ruby [Promise](https://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/1.1.5/Concurrent/Promise.html)
  # which is inspired by Javascript Promises, which is what we actually need
  # for our use case. We can't easily tell when our WebView begins processing
  # our request, which removes the :processing state. This can be used for
  # executing JS, but also generally waiting on events.
  #
  # We don't fully control ordering here, so it *is* conceivable that a
  # child waiting on a parent can be randomly fulfilled, even if we didn't
  # expect it. We don't consider that an error. Similarly, we'll call
  # on_scheduled callbacks if a promise is fulfilled, even though we
  # never explicitly scheduled it. If a promise is *rejected* without
  # ever being scheduled, we won't call those callbacks.
